### Gun Violence as a Paramount Public Health Problem

+ The [American Public Health Association (APHA)](https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/gun-violence) states that gun violence "is a leading cause of premature death in the U.S." More than 38,000 individuals are killed by guns each year, and another 85,000 are injured.
+ Already in 2018, the [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org) has reported 52,422 gun violence incidents in the United States; 325 of these incidents were mass shootings.
+ Since 1996, the [Dickey Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey_Amendment) has acted as a de facto ban on gun violence research by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov). 

### The United States as a Product of Gun Violence...

Gun violence has drastically shaped our attitudes and our political climate. The pervasive nature of gun violence in contemporary America is evinced by a map that is entirely constructed of gun violence incident points. ***Hover over map points to get incident information.***

```{r, echo=FALSE}
gun_v_tidy %>%
	filter(state != "Alaska", state != "Hawaii", longitude < 0) %>% 
	mutate(n_affected_cat = ifelse(n_affected %in% 4:9, 2,
													ifelse(n_affected %in% 10:19, 3,
													ifelse(n_affected %in% 20:34, 4,
													ifelse(n_affected %in% 35:49, 5,
													ifelse(n_affected > 50, 6, 1)))))) %>% 
	mutate(n_affected_cat = as.factor(n_affected_cat),
				 n_affected_cat = recode_factor(n_affected_cat, `1` = "1-3 affected", `2` = "4-9 affected", `3` = "10-19 affected", `4` = "20-34 affected", `5` = "35-49 affected", `6` = "50+ affected"),
				 city_state = str_c(city_or_county, state, sep = ", "), 
				 text_label = str_c(city_state, '\n', year,'\nKilled: ', n_killed, '\nInjured: ', n_injured)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~longitude, y = ~latitude, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
          alpha = 0.5, 
          color = ~n_affected_cat,
  				colors = "Accent",
  				text = ~text_label) %>% 
	layout(legend = list(x = 0.8, y = 0.1))

### Who Should Care About Gun Violence?

**Anybody!**

+ Gun violence requires people, with population dense states experiencing a greater number of gun violence incidents as seen in the map above.
+ However, even the least populated states still have notable gun violence concerns.
+ The "lethality proportion" is defined as the proportion of those affected by a gun violence incident who are killed in that given gun violence incident; it gets at how deadly a given incident was.
+ Wyoming is the *least densely populated* state in the continental United States, but it hast the *highest lethality proportion* for gun violence incidents. 
+ Other states that follow this low population density ~ high lethality proportion paradigm are Idaho, Montana, Alaska, and Nevada.
+ A possible reason for this paradigm is that lack of population density leads to a lower density of healthcare infrastucture, which then leads to isolation during emergencies. 

The plot below shows the national average for the lethality proportion as a dotted line. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
prop_data = 
	gun_v_tidy %>% 
	mutate(prop_killed = n_killed / (n_killed + n_injured))

prop_data %>% 
	summarize(mean = mean(prop_killed))
```

<center>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
prop_data %>% 
	group_by(state) %>% 
	summarize(mean_prop = mean(prop_killed)) %>% 
	mutate(state = forcats::fct_reorder(state, mean_prop)) %>% 
	ggplot(aes(x = state, y = mean_prop)) +
	geom_point() +
	geom_abline(slope = 0, intercept = 0.346, color = "purple", linetype = "dashed") +
	theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 6)) +
	labs(
    x = " ",
    y = "Lethality Proportion"
  )
